# OpenGD77
Firmware for DMR transceivers using the NXP MK22 MCU, AT1846S RF chip and HR-C6000 DMR chipset. Including the Radioddiy GD-77, Baofeng DM-1801 and Baofeng RD-5R.


# Project status

## IMPORTANT
Due to problems with the software license, it is no longer possible to create and distribute the binaries of the firmware. This is because the software license requires that source code for the released project must be available. However this is impossible because approximiately 30% of the firmware file comes from the closed source official firmware.

The firmware is relatively stable and provides DMR and FM audio transmission and reception, as well as a DMR hotspot mode.
However it does not currently support some core functionality that the official firmware supports, including sending and receiving of text messages, or Dual Capacity Direct operation, or Dual Watch operation etc

Not all functionality provided in the official firmware is likely ever to be part of this firmware, because some features like encryption are explicitly prohibited for Amateur Radio operators.

Some functionality like Dual Watch may also not ever be implemented, because it is equivalent to the Channel / Zone scan function.

The project is under active development by several developers.
This does not mean that new non-core functionality changes will be rejected, but bug fixes and core functionality PRâ€™s will take priority

**All PR's should be submitted to the 'development' branch**


# User guide
There is an extensive User Guide https://github.com/rogerclarkmelbourne/OpenGD77/blob/master/docs/OpenGD77_User_Guide.md  however because the firmware is evolving very rapidly, sometimes the User Guide does show the latest features or functions.
