# OpenGD77
Open source firmware for the Radioddity GD-77 (aka TYT MD-760), GD-77S, Baofeng DM-1801 (aka DM-860) and Baofeng RD-5R (DM-5R mk2), dual band DMR / FM handheld transceivers, for Amateur Radio use.

Note.
The AMBE codec is not open source because of potential copyright problems, and instead uses binary sections from original manufacturer’s firmware.

# Project status

The firmware is relatively stable and provides DMR and FM audio transmission and reception, as well as a DMR hotspot mode.
However it does not currently support some core functionality that the official firmware supports, including sending and receiving of text messages, or Dual Capacity Direct operation, or Dual Watch operation etc

Not all functionality provided in the official firmware is likely ever to be part of this firmware, because some features like encryption are explicitly prohibited for Amateur Radio operators.

Some functionality like Dual Watch may also not ever be implemented, because it is equivalent to the Channel / Zone scan function.

The project is under active development by several developers.
This does not mean that new non-core functionality changes will be rejected, but bug fixes and core functionality PR’s will take priority

**All PR's should be submitted to the 'development' branch**


# User guide
There is an extensive User Guide https://github.com/rogerclarkmelbourne/OpenGD77/blob/master/docs/OpenGD77_User_Guide.md  however because the firmware is evolving very rapidly, sometimes the User Guide does show the latest features or functions.
